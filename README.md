## Some karma tests for a most basic Angular application 

- observe that mini.html is served by karma using http://localhost:9876/base/mini.html it also included and hence automatically fetched along the rest of the files in the files property in karma.conf.js.

- in bodytests.ts you can find a simple asynchronous test.

- the rest of the test files are angular test with injection and mocking of services.
